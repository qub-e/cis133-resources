First Resource: HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites 1st Edition by Jon Duckett
Reason: I found this book locally at a Bookmans and skimmed through the content a little. 
        From what I read this book keeps up to modern practices and is pretty thorough in the concepts you need to understand.
        
Second Resource: HTML and CSS Crash Course Playlist by Net Ninja 
                 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G
Reason: Video tutorials are relatively easy to follow, and are good at taking into account that their audience is mainly full of beginners. 
        Since this series is a playlist, it will be easy to find certain concepts as the titles are distinguishable from each other.
